            # Mental Health Application Based Face Recognition

            ## Key Features:
            - **Emotion Detection**: Analyzes user's facial expressions to identify emotions.
            - **Personalized Recommendations**: Provides suggestions based on the user's emotional state.
            - **Professional Integration**: Notifications to contact mental health professionals if needed.

            ## Formulation
            1. **Hash Function (djb2Hash)**

            The hash function is used to generate a unique `FaceID` based on facial landmarks. The formula for the hash function is:
            
            $$
            \text{hash} = 5381 \\
            \text{for each character } i \text{ in the string:} \\
            \text{hash} = (\text{hash} \times 33) + \text{charCodeAt}(i) \\
            \text{return hash } >> 0 \text{(unsigned 32-bit integer)}
            $$
            
            2. **Lip Stretch Calculation (Happiness)**
            
            The lip stretch is calculated using the Euclidean distance between the left and right lip corners:
            
            $$
            \text{lipStretch} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
            $$
            
            3. **Cheek Raise Calculation (Happiness)**
            
            The cheek raise is calculated as the vertical distance between the cheek and eye landmarks:
            
            $$
            \text{cheekRaise} = y_{\text{eye}} - y_{\text{cheek}}
            $$
            
            4. **Lip Depression Calculation (Sadness)**
            
            The lip depression is calculated as the vertical distance between the lip corner and the bottom lip:
            
            $$
            \text{lipDepression} = y_{\text{bottomLip}} - y_{\text{lipCorner}}
            $$
            
            5. **Brow Lowering Calculation (Anger)**
            
            The brow lowering is calculated as the vertical distance between the inner and outer brow landmarks:
            
            $$
            \text{browLower} = y_{\text{innerBrow}} - y_{\text{outerBrow}}
            $$
            
            6. **Eye Openness Calculation (Surprise)**
            
            The eye openness is calculated as the vertical distance between the eyelid and eye landmarks:
            
            $$
            \text{eyeOpenness} = y_{\text{eye}} - y_{\text{eyelid}}
            $$
            
            7. **Jaw Drop Calculation (Surprise)**
            
            The jaw drop is calculated as the vertical distance between the chin and nose landmarks:
            
            $$
            \text{jawDrop} = y_{\text{chin}} - y_{\text{nose}}
            $$
            
            8. **Deviation from Neutral (Neutral Emotion)**
            
            The deviation from neutral is calculated as the sum of Euclidean distances between key facial landmarks:
            
            $$
            \text{deviation} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
            $$
            
            The total deviation from neutral is calculated as the sum of Euclidean distances between key facial landmarks:
            
            $$
            \text{deviation} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sqrt{(x_{2i} - x_{1i})^2 + (y_{2i} - y_{1i})^2}
            $$

            ## Technologies:
            - Face Recognition
            - Emotion Detection
            - Voice Analysis
            - IoT with Health Sensor (e.g., GSR Sensor, MAX30102 Sensor, BH1750 Sensor, and ESP32 Microcontroller)
            - Machine Learning

            ## Usage:
            1. Open the application and allow camera and microphone access.
            2. Let the application analyze your facial expressions.
            3. Receive tailored recommendations based on your condition.

            ## How To Use this Package
            You can copy the command line below:
            
            ```bash
            npm install -g @galihridhoutomo/mentalhealth
            ```

            ### Import Modules into Project
            If using `CommonJS`:
            
            ```js
            const EmotionDetection = require('@galihridhoutomo/mentalhealth');
            ```

            or If using `ES Module (ESM)`:

            ```js
            import EmotionDetection from '@galihridhoutomo/mentalhealth';
            ```

            ### Detecting Emotion from Face Images
            Use the `detectEmotion(imagePath)` function to detect emotions from facial images:
            
            ```js
            EmotionDetection.detectEmotion('path/to/image.jpg')
            .then(result => {
              console.log('Emotion Detection Result:', result);
            })
            .catch(error => {
              console.error('Error:', error);
            });
            ```

            Sample Output:

            ```json
            {
              "emotion": "happy",
              "confidence": 0.92
            }
            ```

            ### Detecting Emotion from Camera in Real-Time
            If you want to detect emotions from the camera, use the `detectEmotionLive()` function:

            ```js
            EmotionDetection.detectEmotionLive()
            .then(result => {
              console.log('Detected Emotion:', result);
            })
            .catch(error => {
              console.error('Error:', error);
            });
            ```

            ### Additional Configuration (Optional)
            You can customize the detection model with the following options:

            ```js
            const options = {
              model: 'advanced',  # Can be 'basic' or 'advanced'
              threshold: 0.8      # Minimum confidence threshold
            };
            
            EmotionDetection.detectEmotion('path/to/image.jpg', options)
              .then(result => console.log(result))
              .catch(error => console.error(error));
            ```
